# qb_scheduler
qb_scheduler is designed to be a fast, user-friendly way to create printable round-robin schedules for quizbowl tournaments.

### Features

* Flexible schedules for any bracketed round-robin format, from 4-48 teams
* Easy to use web interface
* Well-designed LaTeX-set schedules with no LaTeX knowledge or installation required

### Future Plans
* Support for entering game results and rebracketing
* Ability to upload .csv scoresheet and extract game information

I should note that these plans are very tentative and depend on what sort of time I'll have in the near future.

### Inspiration

Sometimes I try and teach myself R and end up answering a question I asked two years ago.
